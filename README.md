# weather-data

I was supplied with a Java library containing weather data recorded at
different locations in the UK during the year 2015. A Second Java library is
provided that allows geographic coordinates to be plotted on a world map.

I was required to write code to answer questions about the data and output
the correct answers.

The questions I have answered were:

1) How many different weather stations does the data cover? The Site Id is a
unique identifier that identifies a weather station. (Each weather station
has thousands of records)

There are 136 Sites

2) What was the minimum temperature recorded? Output the site id, site
name, temperature, Year, Month, Date and Hour that the temperature was
recorded.

3041, AONACH MOR (3041), -26.7, 2015, 3, 6, 13

3) What were the minimum, maximum and mean temperatures recorded at
during March 2015 for the weather station named "ST. BEES HEAD
(3210) ‚Äù?

min = -0.3 max = 9.9 mean = ???? There are 737 entries for Weather station
3210 during March 2015

4) How many days of the year did the temperature fall to 0.0 or below
anywhere in the UK?
Hint : More than 200 but less than 250:

5) What is the most Northerly Weather station? Print out the ID, name,
latitude and longitude of the weather station.

Located at a Longitude of -0.854
